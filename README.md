# Networking abstraction explained by oo paradigm

Wondered what is it really means that `HTTP` is built over `TCP`? 
Amazed by the fact that you can just use networing libraries at your program, and you can talk over the internet through all kinds of media - from twisted pairs, through telephone lines and even sattelite communication?

`Computer Networks` book by Andrew S. Tanenbaum is a great source of knowledge, which I recommend strongly.
