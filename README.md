# Networking abstraction explained by oo paradigm

Have you ever thought about all those conceptual models of computer networks but couldn't really grasp the idea?
Wondered what is it really means that `HTTP` is built over `TCP`? 
Amazed by the fact that you can just use networking libraries at your program, and you can talk over the internet through all kinds of media - from twisted pairs, through telephone lines and even sattelite communication - without worry about any of this?

Well, it is time to get a simplified view of how all this sorcery becomes reality.

## Layers
TODO - brief overview of two main models (TCP/IP and OSI) and the importance of layers architecture.

TODO - brief overview of the entities for each layer (`new TwistedPair`, etc.)

## What's next?
`Computer Networks` book by Andrew S. Tanenbaum is a great source of knowledge, which I recommend strongly.
